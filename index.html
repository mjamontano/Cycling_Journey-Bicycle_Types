    <td><b>Adaptive Bike</b></td>
    <td>makes it possible for nearly everyone to experience the joy and freedom of bicycling<br>
    <br>they may take the form of trikes, hand cycles, tandem recumbents, side-by-side recumbents and more models seem to come onto the market all the time</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="aero_bike.jpg" alt="Aero Road Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Aero Road Bike</b></td>
    <td>take many of the aerodynamic features of a time trial (TT) bike and put them into a more of a regular road race frame<br>
    <br>this does ten to add a bit of weight compared to a race frame; however aero advantages can help save time or reduce the amount of power required to maintain a given speed<br>
    <br>produced in carbon, these bikes feature similar geometry and material lay up as a race frame; expect a low and fast position; cables tend to be hidden out of the air - running internally through the inside of the frame<br>
    <br>coupled with a set of deep section wheels they can offer impressive time savings; the gearing is similar to race bikes (high for more speed and finishing kit is usually lightweight and aero styled)</td>

  <tr><td><img src="adventure_bike.jpg" alt="Adventure Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Adventure Bike</b></td>
    <td>sometimes called super gravel bikes or off-road touring bikes, are gravel bikes that have even more tire clearance and mounting points for racks and bags<br>
    <br>often allow for a more aggressive, wide, knobby tire like a mountain bike tire to aid in traction and comfort<br>
    <br>built for long-distance, multi-day adventures by bike</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="bmx_bike.jpg" alt="BMX Bike"></td>
    <td><b>BMX / Trick Bike</b></td>
    <td>short for bicycle motocross type, has a unique shape; millennial's favorite bike<br>
    <br>usually have wheels that are not as big as racing or fixie bikes, small and slightly tilted frames, and low seats<br>
    <br>the design is made to make it easier for users who usually do freestyle actions on stairs, benches, or the edges of parks or other places in urban areas<br>
    <br>has high handlebar, low seat, small wheels with thick tires; suitable for young people who like freestyle</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="cargo_bike.jpg" alt="Cargo Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Cargo Bike</b></td>
    <td>has helped many families replace a car (or even go completely car free), transport weeks worth of groceries or other large/heavy items you wouldn't think to carry on other bicycles, transport children, pets, and even adults, or just look cool crusing around<br>
    <br>ride like a traditional bike and can maneuver with ease; can accommodate kids and any other gear you might be towing; however, the pilot may not be able to keep an as-attentive eye on any passengers or cargo since it's all behind them<br>
    <br>front loading cargo bikes are great for families; the carrying capacity is comparatively large, and they're easy to load up and hit the road; steering of front loading bikes can take a little getting used to, but once you learn it becomes second nature</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="commuter_bike.jpg" alt="Commuter Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Commuter Bike</b></td>
    <td>the real workhorses of the bike world; built with comfort and durability in mind as they will take a bashing day after day in all weathers<br>
    <br>weight isn't such an issue; frame geometry offers a more upright position for greater comfort and in-traffic vision<br>
    <br>frames have fittings for proper mudguards and racks to keep you dry and so you don't have to carry any weight on your back; wheels are all about strength and longevity and coupled with sturdy tyres offer greater impact protection and increased comfort<br>
    <br>disc brakes are also popular as they offer hassle free stopping and the lack of rim brakes rub means slight wheel buckles are less of a problem; bars can be either drop or flat depending on your preference</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="cruiser_bike.jpg" alt="Cruiser Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Cruiser Bike</b></td>
    <td>also often called "beach cruisers" have upright geometry; ideal for short, leisurely rides on paved trails or boardwalks<br>
    <br>tend to come with fun extra like fenders, kickstands, and baskets<br>
    <br> not well suited for longer rides; only pick a cruiser bike if you're planning on biking short distances around town-or to the beach</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="cyclocross_bike.jpg" alt="Cyclocross Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Cyclocross Bike</b></td>
    <td>designed for a special type of racng called "cyclocross" - they are a special type of hybrid bike that looks like a road bike, but has knobby tires that can handle being ridden thru mud and across grass</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="electric_bike.jpg" alt="Electric Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Electric Bike</b></td>
    <td>uses an electric motor to assist your pedaling<br>
    <br>combination of conventional bicycles with power source technology to support the use of environmentally-friendly vehicles
    <br>these bikes are slowly being adapted to many types of riding and can be a great option to help keep up with faster riders, or for a boost in speed<br>
    <br>can be found in nearly any bike styles; if choosing a mountain e-bike be careful to check trail regulations as many trails do not allow for any motorized transport (which includes e-bikes)</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="fat_bike.jpg" alt="Fat Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Fat Bike</b></td>
    <td>feature tires that are 4 inches in width; provide great traction and floation for sand and snow, but can also be comfortable and fun on trails for mountain bikes<br>
    <br>often used as beach cruisers or riding on snow in the winter; they are most often found in mountain bike or cruiser bike styles</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="fixie_bike.jpg" alt="Fixie Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Fixed-gear Bike</b></td>
    <td>also known as fixie, are not fitted with a freewheel, which means that the rear wheel is locked to the rear cog<br>
    <br>you can pedal forward and backward, but you cannot coast or freewheel on a fixed gear<br>
    <br>normally don't have brakes either (although many riders add one on for safety reasons), and so you slow down and stop by pulling baack on the cranks to slow down the rear wheel<br>
    <br> experienced fixie riders will stop the rear wheel while riding and skid to a stop, but this is definitely something you'll want to practice</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="folding_bike.jpg" alt="Folding Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Folding Bike</b></td>
    <td>really easy to fold allowing them to conveniently fit in you car's trunk, a boat, or on a subway<br>
    <br>they make for great travel companions; consist of small wheels usually being 20-inches that can easily ride through potholes and bumps making up for a smooth ride<br>
    <br>come standard with adjustable functions on the handlebar, folding frame and saddle, enabling an easier folding process<br>
    <br>most folding bikes also consist of adjustable latches that help make the bike collapse easy</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="gravel_bike.jpg" alt="Gravel Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Gravel Bike</b></td>
    <td>they look a lot like a cyclocross bike, but are designed for long-distance gravel road biking<br>
    <br>great for anybody wanting to explore forest service roads, and maybe singletrack or road along the way as well<br>
    <br>can handle mixed terrain (pavement and dirt) with ease, but can't handle tecnical terrain like a mountain bike<br>
    <br>slower rolling on pavement than a road bike</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="hybrid_bike.jpg" alt="Hybrid Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Hybrid Bike</b></td>
    <td>mix between a road bike and a mountain bike; it has tires that can handle a variety of terrain, both paved and dirt<br>
    <br>characterized by an upright design and flat handlebars (not dropbars like a road bike)<br>
    <br>good option to get into cycling or who want to ride a bike for fitness or weight loss<br>
    <br>upright geometry, tires that can go on pavement or gracel</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="kids_bike.png" alt="Kids Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Kids Bike</b></td>
    <td>most common is the standard cruiser-style kids' bike with various miniature wheel sizes<br>
    <br>there are now options for specific kid-sized road bikes and even full-suspension mountain bikes</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="mountain_bike.jpg" alt="Mountain Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Mountain Bike</b></td>
    <td>flat bar bikes with front suspension forks used for riding singletrack trails that can range from smooth dirt paths to rough terrain with features, such as drops, jumps, and rocks<br>
    <br>can be broken into two main categories: hardtail and full suspension, with each category having many sub-categories based on the discipline of mountain biking desired<br>
    <br>hardtail MTBs: no rear supension which will provide better climbing efficiency and greater simplicity, but will sacrifice comfort and some capability<br>
    <br>full-suspension MTBs: have both front and rear suspension forks; this rear suspension enhances comfort, traction and capability, but these bikes are often more expensive and complicated</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="road_bike.jpg" alt="Road Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Road Bike</b></td>
    <td>also known as road racing bikes, are built for riding fast and rollong long distances on smooth road surfaces, and are a great option for riding on open roads<br>
    <br>going to be less comforatble to sit on than a cruiser bike, since they have a more aggressive geometry, but will be much faster and more efficient<br>
    <br>optimized for being lightweight and can be great race bikes, with plent of manufacturers producing high-end bikes with featherweight frames; have narrow tires (skinny tires), which contribute to their speed and efficiency, but reduce comfort over uneven terrain<br>
    <br>often lack rack and fender mounts to maintain peak performance</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="sportive_bike.jpg" alt="Sportive Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Sportive / Endurance Bike</b></td>
    <td>aka Gran Fondo, long-distance mass participation cycling challenge events where the emphasis is on endurance rather than pure speed<br>
    <br>offer a lot of the lightweight benefits of a traditional race bike but with one different attribute - comfort; riding position is more upright offering greater all-day comfort at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency<br>
    <br>frame geometry is also tweaked to offer comfort and more stable/steadier handling over longer distances; tubes are designed to 'give' a little bit - less stiff<br>
    <br>gearing is lower to help cope with big hills without the need for speed; wheels are still lightweight but more robust and disc brakes and larger clearances (for wider tyres)</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="tandem_bike.jpg" alt="Tandem Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Tandem Bike</b></td>
    <td>a bicycle built for two; comes in many styles and are the great leveler of the cycling world<br>
    <br>do not require any special skill to ride and can be great fun<br>
    <br>two riders of different abilities can enjoy a ride at the same pace when riding a tandem</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="touring_bike.jpg" alt="Touring Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Touring Bike</b></td>
    <td>has a shape and acceleration system like a road bike; however, it is equipped with additional special features - storage areas, drinking places, and others in preparation for traveling very long distances<br>
    <br>suitable for users who like long-distance cycling; suitable for paved roads; "overbuilt" is a good description as the frame and components are built to last; despite the weight they are very comfortable<br>
    <br>frame geometry is different, long and relatively upright for greater comfort and easier handling, again crucial when out on long rides with a heavy load; wheels are supper tough, with more spokes than other road bikes<br>
    <br>rims are bombproof to cope with the loads and surfaces; disc brakes are becoming more and more popular as they offer better braking in all conditions especially when carrying heavy loads</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="track_bike.jpg" alt="Track Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Track Bike</b></td>
    <td>fixed-gear bikes, but they are also designed to be fast and aerodynamic<br>
    <br>casual fixies are built with basic frames, whereas track bikes are built with lightweight carbon frames and strong but lightweight handlebars<br>
    <br>meant for velodrome-riding only; only choice for track racing, and are significantly cheaper than other racing frames<br>
    <br>biggest drawbacks: you'll have to change gears constantly between your warm-up, mass start racing, and timed track racing; removing the cogs and chainring is a bit of process, but can be quickly learned by beginner cyclists</td>
    <td>Know More</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="triathlon_bike.jpg" alt="Triathlon Bike"></td>
    <td><b>Triathlon / Time Trial Bike</b></td>
    <td>built specifically for triathlon or time trial events<br>
    <br>road  bikes with a special design that maximizes their aerodynamic properties<br>
    <br>have forward bull-horn shaped handlebars and aero bars that allow the rider to crouch forward while riding, to minimize the wind resistance against the body<br>
    <br>the shifters on these bikes are located at the end of the aero bars</td>
